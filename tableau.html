        <div class="common footer">I tried embeding the tableau graphs but everytime I tried to my computer said that my version of tableau doesn't support the feature. So I thought I would explain it to try and get half points. You first go to server and then to tableau public then you ave to Tableau Public as. You then sign into you tableau public account. It will ask what name to save it under, call it whatever you want to call. Then I would click on share and copy the embed code. I then just paste it into the body of my tableau.html sheet.    </div>
